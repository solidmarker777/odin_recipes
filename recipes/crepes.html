        <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crepes are thin, delicate French pancakes made from a smooth batter, cooked in a hot pan. They have a soft, lacy texture and can be filled with both sweet (like Nutella, fruit, or whipped cream) or savory (like cheese, ham, or veggies) ingredients. Their versatility makes them a popular dish for breakfast, dessert, or even as a meal.</p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <Li>2 large eggs</Li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h2>Make the Batter</h2></li>
        <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and eggs until smooth. Gradually add the milk, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Stir in the melted butter, vanilla extract (for sweet crepes), and salt. The batter should be thin and pourable.</p>
        <li><h2>Let the batter rest</h2></li>
        <p>Cover the bowl and let the batter rest for at least 30 minutes (or up to an hour). This helps the crepes become more tender</p>
        <li><h2>Cook the crepes</h2></li>
        <p>Cook for about 1-2 minutes until the edges start to lift and the bottom is lightly golden. Flip the crepe using a spatula or by gently lifting it and flipping it over in the pan. Cook the other side for another 30 seconds to 1 minute</p>
        <li><h2>Serve</h2></li>
        <p>Stack the cooked crepes on a plate. You can keep them warm in a low oven (around 200°F or 90°C) while you cook the rest</p>
    </ol>
       <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For savory crepes, omit the vanilla and keep the salt. You can fill them with things like sautéed mushrooms, cheese, ham, or spinach.</li>
        <li>For sweet crepes, fill with Nutella, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or a drizzle of syrup.</li>
